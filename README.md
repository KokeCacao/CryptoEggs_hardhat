This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat accounts
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat clean
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
yarn hardhat help
```
